Assam - Aggregator of lemons

* Installation

Install the master build of Zig, then run =$ zig build install -Drelease-safe --prefix DIST=, and then add =DIST/bin= to =$PATH=.
DIST can be, for example, =/usr/local= or =~/.local/=.

My setup:

#+begin_src shell
$ assam | lemonbar -g x30 -f "JetBrains Mono:size=14" -f "Symbols Nerd Font:size=18" -B "#1d1f21" -o 1 -u 2
#+end_src

* Rationale

There is none. This does not need to exist. There are other ways to do this. I repeat. There is no reason for the existence of this project.
